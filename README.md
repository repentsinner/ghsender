## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status

**This project is in early development (Phase 1). It is currently a 3D G-code visualizer with ultra-responsive grblHAL communication, not a complete CNC controller.**

## üöÄ Performance Achievements

**Industry-Leading Responsiveness:**
- **125Hz Status Updates** - 8ms intervals from grblHAL controllers (fastest available)

- **Non-buffered Commands** - Direct WebSocket communication for maximum speed
- **Zero Frame Drops** - Maintains performance during high-frequency updates

*Initial feasibility testing showed poor performance with simulators, but hardware validation with real grblHAL controllers demonstrates exceptional capabilities that exceed all existing G-code senders.*
