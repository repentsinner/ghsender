## Healthy Conflict and Adversarial Collaboration

### Philosophy
Constructive disagreement and challenge are essential for quality outcomes. Team members are **expected and encouraged** to:
- Question assumptions and challenge decisions within their expertise
- Advocate for their domain's best practices even when it creates friction
- Push back on proposals that compromise quality, safety, or maintainability
- Suggest alternative approaches and existing solutions

### Productive Conflict Guidelines

#### When to Be Adversarial
- **System Architect** should challenge domain requirements that create technical debt
- **Product Manager** should question technical solutions that don't serve users
- **Developer** should push back on timelines that compromise code quality
- **Domain Expert** should challenge technical approaches that ignore real-world constraints
- **All roles** should suggest existing tools/frameworks before custom development

#### How to Challenge Effectively
1. **Lead with questions**: "Have you considered..." rather than "You're wrong"
2. **Provide alternatives**: Don't just criticize, offer better solutions
3. **Use evidence**: Reference examples, documentation, or past experience
4. **Focus on outcomes**: Connect challenges to user value or system quality
5. **Acknowledge trade-offs**: Recognize when there are no perfect solutions

#### Sample Adversarial Responses
- "Before we build that, have you looked at [existing solution]? It might save months."
- "That approach will work, but creates maintenance debt. Here's an alternative."
- "I understand the domain need, but that technical approach will be fragile. Let's find a better way."
- "We're reinventing the wheel. [Project X] already solves this and is battle-tested."
- "This requirement would compromise user safety. We need to reconsider the approach."

### Conflict Resolution Process
1. **Present the challenge** with evidence and alternatives
2. **Discuss trade-offs** openly with all stakeholders
3. **Escalate if needed** following the framework below
4. **Document the decision** and rationale for future reference
5. **Commit to the outcome** once decided, regardless of initial position

## Escalation Framework

### Level 1: Autonomous Resolution
Each role attempts to resolve issues within their domain using:
- Existing documentation and guidelines
- Established patterns and precedents
- Domain expertise and best practices
- Consultation with relevant documentation

### Level 2: Peer Consultation
If Level 1 fails, consult with secondary role:
- Technical issues: Developer → System Architect
- Design issues: UX/UI Designer → Product Manager
- Quality issues: Testing Lead → Developer
- Infrastructure issues: DevOps → System Architect

### Level 3: Cross-Functional Escalation
If Level 2 fails, escalate to Product Manager for:
- Business priority and trade-off decisions
- Resource allocation and timeline adjustments
- Stakeholder communication needs
- Scope modification decisions

### Level 4: Project Lead Consultation
Only escalate to Project Lead for:
- Fundamental architecture or product direction changes
- Major resource or timeline implications
- External dependency or partnership decisions
- Strategic business decisions

### Self-Documenting Code Standards

#### Flutter/Dart Documentation
```dart
/// Manages CNC machine connection and communication with grblHAL controllers.
/// 
/// This service handles:
/// - TCP/IP connection establishment and management
/// - Command queue processing with priority handling
/// - Real-time status updates and state synchronization
/// - Error handling and automatic reconnection
/// 
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final machine = MachineConnectionService();
/// await machine.connect('192.168.1.100', 23);
/// machine.sendCommand(GCodeCommand.homeAll());
/// ```
/// 
/// See also:
/// - [GCodeCommand] for command construction
/// - [MachineState] for status monitoring
class MachineConnectionService {
  /// Establishes connection to grblHAL controller.
  /// 
  /// [ipAddress] must be a valid IPv4 address
  /// [port] typically 23 for grblHAL telnet interface
  /// 
  /// Throws [ConnectionException] if connection fails
  /// Throws [ValidationException] if parameters are invalid
  Future<void> connect(String ipAddress, int port) async {
    // Implementation...
  }
}
```
