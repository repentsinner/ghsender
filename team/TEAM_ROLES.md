## Escalation Framework

### Level 1: Autonomous Resolution
Each role attempts to resolve issues within their domain using:
- Existing documentation and guidelines
- Established patterns and precedents
- Domain expertise and best practices
- Consultation with relevant documentation

### Level 2: Peer Consultation
If Level 1 fails, consult with secondary role:
- Technical issues: Developer → System Architect
- Design issues: UX/UI Designer → Product Manager
- Quality issues: Testing Lead → Developer
- Infrastructure issues: DevOps → System Architect

### Level 3: Cross-Functional Escalation
If Level 2 fails, escalate to Product Manager for:

### Self-Documenting Code Standards

#### Flutter/Dart Documentation
```dart
/// Manages CNC machine connection and communication with grblHAL controllers.
/// 
/// This service handles:
/// - TCP/IP connection establishment and management
/// - Command queue processing with priority handling
/// - Real-time status updates and state synchronization
/// - Error handling and automatic reconnection
/// 
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final machine = MachineConnectionService();
/// await machine.connect('192.168.1.100', 23);
/// machine.sendCommand(GCodeCommand.homeAll());
/// ```
/// 
/// See also:
/// - [GCodeCommand] for command construction
/// - [MachineState] for status monitoring
class MachineConnectionService {
  /// Establishes connection to grblHAL controller.
  /// 
  /// [ipAddress] must be a valid IPv4 address
  /// [port] typically 23 for grblHAL telnet interface
  /// 
  /// Throws [ConnectionException] if connection fails
  /// Throws [ValidationException] if parameters are invalid
  Future<void> connect(String ipAddress, int port) async {
    // Implementation...
  }
}
```
