# Static Analysis and Git Hooks

This document describes the static analysis setup and git commit hooks for the Flutter project in this repository.

## Current Status

The Flutter project in the root directory currently has **no static analysis issues**:

- **0 errors** ✅
- **0 warnings** ✅ 
- **0 info/lint issues** ✅

All code follows Flutter best practices and passes static analysis checks.

## Static Analysis Tools

We use the following static analysis tools:

- `dart analyze` - Dart's built-in static analyzer
- `flutter analyze` - Flutter's wrapper around dart analyze with additional Flutter-specific checks

Both tools use the configuration in `analysis_options.yaml` which includes:
- `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` - Standard Flutter lint rules
- Custom rule overrides as needed

## Git Commit Hooks

Two git pre-commit hooks have been set up to ensure code quality:

### 1. Lenient Hook (Active) - `/Users/ritchie/development/ghsender/.git/hooks/pre-commit`

- **Only blocks commits** for actual errors (not warnings)
- Uses `dart analyze` without `--fatal-warnings`
- Allows info/warning issues to pass through
- Currently active - prevents commits only when errors are found

### 2. Strict Hook (Alternative) - `/Users/ritchie/development/ghsender/.git/hooks/pre-commit-errors-only`

- **Blocks commits** when any warnings or errors are found
- Uses `dart analyze --fatal-warnings` 
- Ensures highest code quality standards
- Available as an alternative for stricter enforcement

## Using the Hooks

### Normal Development
Just commit as usual:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

If static analysis issues are found, the commit will be blocked with helpful output.

### Bypassing the Hook (Emergency Only)
If you need to commit urgent changes despite static analysis issues:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency commit - analysis issues to be fixed"
```

**Note:** Use `--no-verify` sparingly and always fix issues in follow-up commits.

### Switching Hook Modes
To switch from lenient to strict mode:
```bash
cd /Users/ritchie/development/ghsender/.git/hooks
mv pre-commit pre-commit-lenient
mv pre-commit-errors-only pre-commit
```

To switch back to lenient mode:
```bash
cd /Users/ritchie/development/ghsender/.git/hooks
mv pre-commit pre-commit-errors-only  
mv pre-commit-lenient pre-commit
```

## Maintaining Code Quality

Since the project currently has no static analysis issues, focus on maintaining this clean state:

### Best Practices

1. **Import Management**
   ```dart
   // Use package imports for lib/ code
   import 'package:ghsender/bloc/problems/problems_bloc.dart';
   
   // Remove unused imports immediately
   ```

2. **Logging Standards**
   ```dart
   // Use structured logging with AppLogger
   import 'package:ghsender/utils/logger.dart';
   
   AppLogger.info('Operation completed successfully');
   AppLogger.error('Failed to process request', error, stackTrace);
   ```

3. **Override Annotations**
   ```dart
   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     // Always add @override for overridden methods
   }
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   ```dart
   try {
     // code that might throw
   } catch (e) {
     rethrow; // Use rethrow instead of throw e
   }
   ```

### Common Issues to Avoid

- **Don't** use `print()` statements - use `AppLogger` instead
- **Don't** commit unused imports
- **Always** add `@override` annotations
- **Prefer** package imports over relative imports for `lib/` code

## Running Analysis Locally

### Check all issues:
```bash
# Analyze main application code only
flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos lib/ test/

# Analyze everything (including context/toolchain - not recommended)
flutter analyze
```

### Check errors only:
```bash
dart analyze lib/ test/
```

### Get detailed output:
```bash
dart analyze --verbose lib/ test/
```

**Note**: The project includes context and toolchain directories with external code that may have analysis issues. Focus analysis on `lib/` and `test/` directories for the main application.

## Configuration Files

### `analysis_options.yaml`
```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    # Custom overrides can be added here
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to allow print statements
```

### `pubspec.yaml` (dev dependencies)
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_lints: ^6.0.0  # Provides lint rules
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

## Continuous Integration

When setting up CI/CD, ensure static analysis is run:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run static analysis
  run: |
    flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos lib/ test/
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Before starting new work**: Run `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos lib/ test/` to verify clean state
2. **During development**: Fix any new issues you introduce immediately
3. **Before committing**: Ensure your changes pass static analysis
4. **Maintain clean state**: Address any new issues before they accumulate

## Team Guidelines

- **New code**: Must pass static analysis without errors (warnings allowed)
- **Code quality**: Maintain current clean state - don't introduce new issues  
- **Logging**: Use `AppLogger` instead of `print()` statements
- **Imports**: Use package imports for `lib/` code, remove unused imports immediately
- **Override annotations**: Always add `@override` for overridden members
- **Test imports**: Use package imports (`package:ghsender/...`) not relative imports (`../../lib/...`)
