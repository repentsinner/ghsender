## Archive

Historical documentation has been preserved in the `archive/` directory:
- `archive/analysis/` - Technical analysis documents (decisions made)
- `archive/workflows/` - Workflow specifications (features not implemented)
- `archive/widgets/` - Widget specifications (components not built)
- `archive/development/` - Detailed setup guides (consolidated into GETTING_STARTED.md)

## Contributing to Documentation

1. **Update main documents** - Keep the 4 core documents current
2. **Avoid creating new files** - Add to existing documents unless absolutely necessary
3. **Maintain honesty** - Clear distinction between implemented vs. planned
4. **Cross-reference** - Link between related sections in different documents
