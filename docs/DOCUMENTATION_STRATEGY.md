# Documentation Strategy and Standards

**Author**: Technical Writer & System Architect  
**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Purpose**: Define comprehensive documentation strategy, standards, and implementation approach for the G-Code sender project

## Documentation Mission Statement

Our documentation strategy follows the **"Docs as Code"** philosophy to create a self-documenting codebase that enables autonomous development, reduces onboarding time, and provides comprehensive support for users and developers at all skill levels.

## Core Documentation Principles

### 1. Self-Documenting Codebase
- **Every public API must have comprehensive documentation**
- **Code should be readable and self-explanatory**
- **Complex algorithms require implementation comments**
- **Error conditions and exceptions must be documented**
- **Performance characteristics noted for critical paths**

### 2. Documentation as Code
- **Documentation lives alongside code in version control**
- **Automated generation and deployment of documentation**
- **Documentation updates required for all code changes**
- **Quality gates enforce documentation standards**
- **Continuous integration for documentation validation**

### 3. Multi-Audience Support
- **End Users**: Clear workflows and troubleshooting guides
- **Developers**: API documentation and implementation guides
- **System Administrators**: Deployment and configuration guides
- **Contributors**: Development setup and contribution guidelines

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
- **Beginner-friendly entry points with advanced details available**
- **Quick reference guides for experts**
- **Contextual help and guidance within the application**
- **Learning paths that grow with user competency**

## Documentation Architecture

### Primary Documentation Outputs

**Note on 'context' folder**: The `context` folder contains external projects imported to provide additional reference and understanding for agents. Files within these sub-directories are considered external context and are not part of the project's official documentation. They should not be treated as project documentation or subject to the same documentation standards.

#### 1. API Reference Documentation
**Generated from**: Source code using framework-native documentation tools  
**Target Audience**: Developers integrating with or extending the system  
**Hosted at**: `/api-docs/` subdirectory  
**Update Frequency**: Automatically on every commit  

**Standards**:
- Every public interface, class, method, and function must have comprehensive inline documentation
- Include usage examples for all public APIs
- Document all parameters, return values, and error conditions
- Cross-reference related components and modules
- Include performance notes for critical operations
- Follow language-specific documentation conventions (JSDoc for TypeScript, dartdoc for Dart, etc.)

#### 2. User Documentation
**Generated from**: Markdown files using MkDocs Material  
**Target Audience**: End users, CNC operators, workshop managers  
**Hosted at**: ReadTheDocs.io primary site  
**Update Frequency**: Weekly releases with hotfixes as needed  

**Content Areas**:
- Getting started guides and tutorials
- Workflow documentation (from `/docs/workflows/`)
- Troubleshooting and FAQ
- Feature reference and configuration
- Safety guidelines and best practices

#### 3. Developer Documentation
**Generated from**: Markdown with embedded diagrams  
**Target Audience**: Contributors, integrators, system architects  
**Hosted at**: `/dev-docs/` subdirectory  
**Update Frequency**: Automatically on architecture changes  

**Content Areas**:
- Architecture overview and design decisions
- Development environment setup
- Contribution guidelines and standards
- Testing strategy and quality gates
- Deployment and release procedures
- Observability strategy and instrumentation (`docs/analysis/OBSERVABILITY.md`)

#### 4. Security Documentation
**Generated from**: Specialized security templates  
**Target Audience**: Security teams, compliance officers, auditors  
**Hosted at**: Private documentation site (access controlled)  
**Update Frequency**: Quarterly reviews with immediate updates for incidents  

**Content Areas**:
- Threat model and risk assessments
- Security architecture and controls
- Incident response procedures
- Compliance mapping and audit trails
- Secure coding guidelines

- Cross-references to related components
- Complete usage examples in the target language

**Method/Function Documentation Requirements:**
- Clear description of purpose and behavior
- All parameters documented with types and constraints
- Return value description and possible values
- Error conditions and exception types
- Side effects and state changes
- When to use this method vs alternatives
- Code examples demonstrating typical usage

**Error/Exception Documentation Requirements:**
- Clear description of when the error occurs
- Common causes and triggering conditions

- Related errors and escalation paths

#### Framework-Specific Implementation Examples

**TypeScript/JavaScript (JSDoc)**
```typescript
/**
 * Manages CNC machine connection and communication with grblHAL controllers.
 * 
 * This service handles:
 * - TCP/IP connection establishment and management
 * - Command queue processing with priority handling
 * - Real-time status updates and state synchronization
 * - Error handling and automatic reconnection
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const machine = new MachineConnectionService();
 * await machine.connect('192.168.1.100', 23);
 * machine.sendCommand(new GCodeCommand('G28'));
 * ```
 * 
 * @see {@link GCodeCommand} for command construction
 * @see {@link MachineState} for status monitoring
 */
class MachineConnectionService {
  /**
   * Establishes connection to grblHAL controller.
   * 
   * @param ipAddress - Valid IPv4 address
   * @param port - Port number (typically 23 for grblHAL telnet)
   * @throws {ConnectionException} When connection fails
   * @throws {ValidationException} When parameters are invalid
   */
  async connect(ipAddress: string, port: number): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation...
  }
}
```

**Dart (dartdoc)**
```dart
/// Manages CNC machine connection and communication with grblHAL controllers.
/// 
/// This service handles:
/// - TCP/IP connection establishment and management  
/// - Command queue processing with priority handling
/// - Real-time status updates and state synchronization
/// - Error handling and automatic reconnection
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final machine = MachineConnectionService();
/// await machine.connect('192.168.1.100', 23);
/// machine.sendCommand(GCodeCommand.homeAll());
/// ```
/// 
/// See also:
/// - [GCodeCommand] for command construction
/// - [MachineState] for status monitoring
class MachineConnectionService {
  /// Establishes connection to grblHAL controller.
  /// 
  /// [ipAddress] must be a valid IPv4 address
  /// [port] typically 23 for grblHAL telnet interface
  /// 
  /// Throws [ConnectionException] if connection fails
  /// Throws [ValidationException] if parameters are invalid
  Future<void> connect(String ipAddress, int port) async {
    // Implementation...
  }
}
```

# Service Integration: Machine Controller Communication

## Overview
This document describes the integration between the G-Code sender application
and grblHAL controllers, including protocol specification, error handling,
and performance considerations.

## Architecture Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as G-Code Sender
    participant TCP as TCP Connection
    participant Controller as grblHAL Controller
    
    App->>TCP: Connect(ip, port)
    TCP->>Controller: Establish Connection
    Controller-->>TCP: Connection Acknowledged
    TCP-->>App: Connection Established
    
    App->>TCP: Send G-Code Command
    TCP->>Controller: Command String
    Controller-->>TCP: Status Response
    TCP-->>App: Command Result
```

## Protocol Specification
- Connection: TCP/IP on port 23 (telnet)
- Encoding: ASCII text with CRLF line endings
- Command format: Standard G-Code with grblHAL extensions
- Response format: JSON status messages + plain text acknowledgments

## Error Handling Strategy
- Connection timeouts: 30 second initial, 5 second keepalive
- Retry logic: Exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
- Graceful degradation: Queue commands locally if connection lost
- Recovery procedures: Automatic reconnection with state sync

## Performance Characteristics
- Typical latency: <50ms for command acknowledgment
- Throughput: 1000+ commands per minute sustainable
- Memory usage: <1MB for command queue and status tracking
- CPU usage: <5% during normal operation
```
