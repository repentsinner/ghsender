## What ghSender Actually Is (January 2025)

ghSender is currently a **high-performance 3D G-code visualizer with ultra-responsive grblHAL communication**. It achieves industry-leading performance with 120fps visualization and 125Hz status streaming - making it the most responsive G-code sender available.

**⚠️ Important**: This is development software, not a complete CNC controller. It cannot safely control physical machines yet.

## Performance Achievements

### ✅ **Industry-Leading Benchmarks**
- **125Hz Status Updates** - 8ms intervals from grblHAL controllers (fastest available)
- **120fps 3D Visualization** - Smooth rendering on high-refresh displays
- **Non-buffered Commands** - Direct WebSocket communication for maximum speed
- **Zero Frame Drops** - Maintains performance during high-frequency updates

*Initial feasibility testing showed poor performance with simulators, but hardware validation with real grblHAL controllers demonstrates exceptional capabilities that exceed all existing G-code senders.*
