# Widget Framework Analysis

## Component Context

The widget framework provides the foundation for our application's user interface, with a particular focus on hosting the Visualizer component and providing the necessary context for G-Code simulation and machine control. The choice of framework significantly impacts our ability to deliver a responsive, professional-grade CNC control interface.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Application Shell**
   - Window/viewport management
   - Layout and responsive design
   - Theme and styling system
   - Input handling and events

2. **Visualizer Integration**
   - Provides 3D rendering context
   - Manages GL/GPU surface lifecycle
   - Handles viewport resizing
   - Coordinates touch/mouse interaction

3. **Runtime Integration**
   - State management for machine control
   - Real-time updates and streaming
   - Background processing coordination
   - Error handling and recovery

## Framework Comparison

## 2. Performance Comparison

- Consistent 60/120fps with optimized shader compilation
- Minimal jank through precompiled shaders
- Lower memory footprint with optimized asset management
- Better handling of complex animations with hardware acceleration

**React + MUI**:
- Browser rendering limitations
- Variable performance across platforms
- Electron overhead impacts memory usage
- GPU acceleration through CSS transforms
- May require optimization for complex UIs

### 2.2 Memory Usage
**Flutter**:
- Typically 60-120MB base memory footprint
- Efficient memory management through Dart VM
- Predictable garbage collection
- Lower per-widget memory overhead

**React + MUI**:
- 150-300MB base memory footprint (Electron)
- Browser memory management
- Less predictable garbage collection
- Higher per-component memory overhead

## 3. Development Experience

### 3.1 Widget/Component Creation
**Flutter**:
```dart
class CustomWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;

  const CustomWidget({
    required this.title,
    required this.onPressed,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: onPressed,
        child: Text(title),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**React + MUI**:
```typescript
interface CustomComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onPressed: () => void;
}

const CustomComponent: React.FC<CustomComponentProps> = ({
  title,
  onPressed,
}) => {
  return (
    <Button
      variant="contained"
      onClick={onPressed}
    >
      {title}
    </Button>
  );
};
```

### 3.2 Tooling Support
**Flutter**:
- Comprehensive IDE support (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Built-in DevTools for debugging
- Hot reload with state preservation
- Built-in widget inspector
- Strong static analysis
