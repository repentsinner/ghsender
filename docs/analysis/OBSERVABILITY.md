# Observability Strategy for End-User Application

**Author**: Gemini

**Purpose**: Define the observability strategy for the G-Code sender application, focusing on its role in aiding agent-assisted debugging during development, while acknowledging its nature as end-user software.

## Philosophy: Debugging with Agent Assistance

For an end-user application like the G-Code sender, our observability strategy is primarily geared towards providing sufficient insight for rapid debugging and issue resolution during development and testing phases. This differs from the extensive, real-time, and high-volume observability typically required for infrastructure or backend services. The goal is to empower AI agents (like Gemini and Claude) to efficiently diagnose runtime issues, understand application behavior, and identify root causes without requiring direct human intervention for data collection.

## Key Observability Components

To facilitate agent-assisted debugging, the application will be instrumented with the following:

### 1. Structured Logging

-   **Purpose**: To record significant events, state changes, user interactions, and errors in a machine-readable format.
-   **Details**:
    -   **Event Logging**: Key application lifecycle events (e.g., app start/stop, machine connection/disconnection, job start/end, tool changes).
    -   **State Changes**: Important changes in machine state, application settings, or UI state.
    -   **User Actions**: High-level user interactions (e.g., button clicks, file loads, jog commands).
    -   **Error & Warning Logs**: Detailed information for exceptions, unexpected conditions, and potential issues.
    -   **Contextual Data**: Logs will include relevant context such as timestamps, module/component, log level, and unique identifiers (e.g., session ID, job ID).
-   **Agent Utility**: Agents can parse structured logs to reconstruct execution flows, identify sequences of events leading to an issue, and pinpoint the exact moment an error occurred.

### 2. Application Metrics

-   **Purpose**: To capture quantitative data about the application's performance and resource usage.
-   **Details**:
    -   **Performance Metrics**: Latency for critical operations (e.g., G-code parsing time, command send/receive time, UI render times).
    -   **Resource Usage**: Basic CPU/memory footprint (especially for long-running operations).
    -   **Feature Usage (Development Only)**: Anonymous counts of feature activations to understand usage patterns during testing.
-   **Agent Utility**: Agents can correlate metrics with log events to identify performance bottlenecks, resource leaks, or unexpected behavior under load.

### 3. Centralized Error Reporting (Development Builds)

-   **Purpose**: To automatically capture and report unhandled exceptions and crashes.
-   **Details**:
    -   Integration with a local or development-only error reporting service (e.g., Sentry, Crashlytics, or a simple file-based logger).
    -   Reports will include stack traces, relevant system information, and recent log entries leading up to the error.
-   **Agent Utility**: Agents can quickly access crash reports, analyze stack traces, and use accompanying context to reproduce and debug critical failures.

### 4. Contextual Information & Debugging Flags

-   **Purpose**: To provide agents with additional runtime context and control over debugging verbosity.
-   **Details**:
    -   **Machine State Snapshots**: Ability to log or retrieve the full machine state (e.g., Grbl status, coordinate system, active modals) at critical junctures.
    -   **Development-only Debugging Flags**: Configuration options to enable more verbose logging, specific diagnostic outputs, or simulated conditions during development.
-   **Agent Utility**: Agents can request specific contextual data or enable/disable debugging flags to gather more targeted information for complex scenarios.

## Distinction from Infrastructure Observability

Unlike backend services or infrastructure, this end-user application will not typically require:
-   **High-volume distributed tracing**: As it's a single-process application, complex distributed tracing is generally not necessary.
-   **Extensive real-time dashboards for production**: While some basic metrics might be exposed, the primary focus is on development-time debugging, not 24/7 operational monitoring for a fleet of servers.
-   **Complex alerting pipelines for end-users**: Alerts will primarily be for developers during testing, not for end-users experiencing issues in production (where in-app error messages and support channels are more appropriate).

## Privacy Considerations

All observability data collected will be strictly for **development and testing purposes**. No personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive user data will be collected or transmitted without explicit, informed user consent. Production builds will have reduced logging verbosity and will adhere to strict data privacy policies.

This strategy ensures that agents have the necessary visibility into the application's runtime behavior to effectively assist in debugging and development, without over-instrumenting for an end-user context.
