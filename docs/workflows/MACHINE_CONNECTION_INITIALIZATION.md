}
```

**Assessment Criteria:**
1. **Power Cycle Detection**
   - Controller restart clears position knowledge
   - Requires fresh homing sequence
   - Cannot rely on previous position information
   - Must establish new reference frame

2. **Alarm History Analysis**

- Pre-homing safety checklist
- Homing method selection (if multiple options)
- Real-time homing feedback and position display

**Homing Decision Matrix:**
```typescript
interface HomingStrategy {
  method: 'full_home' | 'axis_selective' | 'reference_return' | 'manual_positioning';
  axes: AxisSet[];
  sequence: HomingSequence;
  safetyChecks: SafetyCheck[];
  estimatedTime: number;
  riskAssessment: RiskLevel;
}

interface HomingRequirements {
  mandatory: boolean;
  reason: HomingReason[];
  urgency: 'immediate' | 'before_operation' | 'recommended';
  alternatives: HomingStrategy[];
}

function analyzeHomingRequirements(
  machineState: MachineState,
  userContext: UserContext
): HomingRequirements {
  // Determine if homing is mandatory or optional
  // Select appropriate homing strategy
  // Assess safety requirements and precautions
}
```

**Homing Strategy Selection:**
1. **Full Machine Homing**
   - All axes homed to establish complete reference frame
   - Required after power cycles or critical alarms
   - Provides highest confidence in position accuracy
   - Takes longest time but ensures complete system integrity

2. **Selective Axis Homing**
   - Home only specific axes that lost position knowledge
   - Faster than full homing for specific scenarios
   - Requires careful analysis of which axes need homing
   - May be suitable for minor alarm recoveries

3. **Reference Position Return**
   - Return to known reference without full homing cycle
   - Suitable when position knowledge is still valid
   - Quick verification of current position accuracy
   - Good for position confidence verification

4. **Manual Position Verification**
   - User-guided position verification without automatic homing
   - Suitable for expert users in specific circumstances
   - Requires manual confirmation of safe positioning
   - Used when automatic homing is not practical

### 4.2 Pre-Homing Safety Assessment

3. **Emergency Preparedness**
   - Ensure emergency stop is accessible and functional
   - Verify operator is ready to intervene if necessary
   - Confirm safe operator positioning during homing
   - Prepare for unexpected movements or behaviors

4. **System Status Verification**
   - Check power supply stability and voltage levels
   - Verify stepper drivers are operational
   - Confirm communication link is stable and responsive
   - Validate no hardware error conditions exist
