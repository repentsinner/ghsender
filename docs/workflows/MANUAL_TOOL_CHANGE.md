### 6.3 Manual Reference Surface Touchoff
**Purpose**: Measure tool length using manual touchoff on reference surface

**UI Elements Required:**
- Jog Controls Widget with fine positioning capability
- Real-time position display during touchoff
- Reference surface selection and guidance
- Offset calculation and application interface

**Touchoff Procedure:**
1. **Reference Surface Preparation**
   - Select appropriate reference surface (workpiece top, reference block)
   - Verify surface is clean, flat, and representative
   - Ensure surface accessibility and safety for touchoff
   - Record reference surface height relative to work zero

2. **Controlled Tool Approach**
   - Position tool above reference surface at safe height
   - Use progressive jog speeds for safe approach
   - Approach surface carefully with fine positioning
   - Feel for definitive tool contact with surface

3. **Contact Detection and Recording**
   - Establish positive tool contact with reference surface
   - Verify contact consistency across tool diameter
   - Record contact position with high precision
   - Note any surface deflection or irregularities

4. **Offset Calculation and Application**
   - Calculate tool length offset from contact position
   - Account for reference surface height if applicable
   - Apply calculated offset to tool length compensation
   - Verify offset application in controller

**Practical Touchoff Techniques:**

**How to Feel for Tool Contact:**
- **Start High**: Begin 5-10mm above surface, use rapid jog to get close
- **Slow Down**: Switch to 1mm jog when within 2mm of surface
- **Final Approach**: Use 0.1mm or 0.01mm jog for final contact
- **Feel the Contact**: Tool should just touch - you'll feel slight resistance to further movement
- **Paper Test**: Slide paper under tool - should grip slightly when tool touches

**Common Surface References:**
- **Workpiece Top**: Most common, works with varying material thickness
- **Gauge Block**: Precision reference, add block height to calculation  
- **Spoilboard**: Consistent reference, but requires exact material thickness
- **Previous Tool Position**: Return to last good tool position (for tool changes mid-job)

**Surface Quality Guidelines:**
- **Good**: Machined surface, clean metal, flat reference block
- **Okay**: Sanded wood, filed metal, clean cut plastic
- **Avoid**: Rough surfaces, painted surfaces, curved surfaces, dirty surfaces

**Touchoff Guidance by Competency:**

**Beginner Guidance:**
- Use paper test method: slide 0.1mm paper under tool, lower until paper grips
- Start with 1mm jog, then 0.1mm, then 0.01mm for final approach
- Take time - rushing leads to crashes or inaccurate measurements
- Verify by lifting tool 0.1mm and trying again

**Intermediate Guidance:**
- Feel-based contact without paper once comfortable
- Use appropriate reference surfaces for your operation type
- Understand when precision matters vs. when "close enough" works

**Expert Guidance:**
- Quick visual/feel contact detection without paper
- Advanced techniques for difficult-to-reach surfaces
- Integration with production procedures and time optimization
- Efficient workflow with minimal confirmations
- Integration with production procedures

   - Confirm emergency stop operation

2. **Tool Function Testing** (if safe and appropriate)
   - Brief spindle operation at low speed
   - Monitor for unusual vibration or noise
   - Check tool concentricity and runout
   - Verify tool is operating normally

3. **Program Context Testing**
   - Position tool at program resumption point
   - Verify tool position relative to workpiece
   - Check coordinate system relationships
   - Confirm readiness for program resumption

**Error Handling:**
- **Installation Problems**: Guide through reinstallation
- **Measurement Errors**: Repeat measurement procedures
- **Operational Issues**: Address mechanical or setup problems
- **System Integration Failures**: Resolve controller communication issues

## 8. Program Resumption Integration

### 8.1 Context Restoration
**Purpose**: Restore exact program execution context after tool change

**UI Elements Required:**
- Program state restoration display
- Position verification interface
- Modal state confirmation
- Resumption readiness checklist

**Context Restoration Steps:**
1. **Program Position Restoration**
   - Return to exact program execution position
   - Verify position accuracy within tolerance
   - Confirm coordinate system relationships
   - Validate tool position relative to workpiece

2. **Modal State Restoration**
   - Restore feed rate and spindle speed settings
   - Reactivate coolant if previously active
   - Confirm coordinate system and offset states
   - Verify all modal commands are properly set

3. **System State Verification**
   - Check communication with controller
   - Verify all safety systems are operational
   - Confirm tool change completion in system
   - Validate readiness for program resumption

### 8.2 Safe Program Resumption
**Purpose**: Resume program execution safely after tool change

**Resumption Procedures:**
1. **Pre-Resumption Validation**
   - Verify tool installation and measurement accuracy
   - Confirm program context restoration
   - Check safety systems and emergency stop
   - Validate operator readiness for resumption

2. **Controlled Program Restart**
   - Resume from exact program interruption point
   - Monitor initial movements carefully
   - Verify tool operation and performance
   - Confirm normal execution characteristics

3. **Post-Resumption Monitoring**
   - Monitor tool performance in initial operations
   - Watch for any unusual behavior or issues
   - Verify cut quality and dimensional accuracy
   - Confirm successful tool change integration

## 9. Learning System Integration

### 9.1 Tool Change Competency Assessment
**Purpose**: Track and assess user tool change competency for adaptive workflows

**Competency Metrics:**
```typescript
interface ToolChangeCompetency {
  successfulChanges: number;
  averageChangeTime: number;
  measurementAccuracy: number;
  safetyCompliance: number;
  errorRate: number;
  independentCompletion: boolean;
}

interface AdaptiveToolChangeWorkflow {
  guidanceLevel: 'verbose' | 'standard' | 'minimal';
  confirmationRequirement: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  safetyReminderFrequency: 'constant' | 'periodic' | 'minimal';
  autoAdvanceEnabled: boolean;
  expertShortcutsAvailable: boolean;
}
```

**Learning Progression:**
- **Beginner → Intermediate**: Reduce confirmation steps after 5 successful tool changes
- **Intermediate → Expert**: Enable advanced features after 15 successful changes
- **Error Response**: Temporarily increase guidance level after any tool change errors
- **Safety Maintenance**: Always maintain safety protocols regardless of competency

### 9.2 Performance Optimization
**Purpose**: Improve tool change efficiency based on user patterns and feedback

**Optimization Areas:**
- Tool change time reduction through workflow refinement
- Measurement accuracy improvement through technique coaching
- Error prevention through pattern recognition
- Safety compliance through positive reinforcement
